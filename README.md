# Copilot_Studio-APIM-MCP-SAP-template
This no-code repository explains how to create a Microsoft Copilot Studio Agent that calls SAP OData services in real time.

# Scenario:

You want to interact with your SAP data using conversational AI, in channels such as Copilot or Teams. SAP already provides Joule for this purpose. However, if you're not on SAP RISE, you cannot profit from this solution - this is where Microsoft Copilot helps. By exposing your existing or new OData services on Azure API Management and using the built-in MCP wizard, you can easily set up Agentic AI and deploy this into your favourite channels, such as Microsoft Copilot, Teams, or elsewhere.

# Components needed:

1. An SAP system with active OData services (we will use a standard "test" service for this template)
2. Azure API Management to expose your OData service
3. Microsoft Copilot Studio for building the agent

# Time to complete:

Roughly 30 minutes

Proceed to Step 1 to continue:
